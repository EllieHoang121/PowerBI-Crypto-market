# PowerBI-Tracking-crypto-market

The project uses PowerBI to illustrate the trading situation of a blockchain platform, run by business K. The business took 2% of the transaction as the trading fee.

The project's main objective was to demonstrate the trading situation of the platform so that viewers could gain an understanding of the trading traffic in the blockchain platform, the geographic distribution of traders as well as the distribution of platform types, and which kind of crypto was favorable by traders. 

Before we start analyzing the dashboard, let's take a look at the short introduction to cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency, created by using encryption algorithms. It is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a financial system or government authorities and Bitcoin is the pioneering cryptocurrency. After Bitcoin opened a new age of cryptocurrency, all cryptocurrencies invented after it were called altcoins.
Another type of coin is stablecoin. Stablecoins aim to mitigate the inherent price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies by pegging their value to stable assets, fostering a more reliable medium of exchange, and enhancing the stability of the broader digital currency landscape.

A breakdown of how this was achieved:

Setup Process:

Step 1: Gathering data from the source.
Step 2: Importing the data into PowerBI.
Step 3: Doing data modeling.
Step 4: Identifying necessary metrics and doing calculations.
Step 5: Building dashboard.

Conclusion:

In general, there was an increase in revenue throughout the period and significant fluctuation between February and March 2022 with the peak at 5708.3, which was also the highest revenue in that period. The reason for this great fluctuation may be because of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine at that time. The conflict negatively affected the world economy, leading to the rise of inflation and the world's economic recession. 

According to the dashboard, most transactions were done on Friday, followed by Saturday, and Sunday. The market seemed to be gray on the first days of the week due to the low starting price point then rising throughout the week. Banks do not work in the weekend so investors may not be able to add money to their accounts. Therefore, Friday was recorded to have the most transactions as traders tended to finish all of the trading before the weekend.

Since the company mainly operates in Vietnam, it is undoubtedly that Vietnam brought the highest revenue. Venezuela, Australia, Colombia, and Turkey were the other countries in the top 5 countries that brought the most revenue to the company.

More than half of the transactions were done on the web and the favorite operating system was Windows as they did not need to install it and traders were used to web rather than mobile apps. Android was fond of more than IOS. This may be because there were more Android users than IOS users.

It can be seen that traders prefer altcoins more than stablecoins, as altcoins took nearly 70% of the total revenue. The reason for this was altcoins had higher volatility in price and they could provide massive returns on investments (ROI) for early investors, which proved that traders were likely to be fond of the result of high returns in a short time although it was risky, rather than be a solid investor and gain long-term profits. 

Like Bitcoin, altcoins are also subject to price volatility. The best altcoins have the potential to capture a sizable market share by improving on Bitcoinâ€™s original consensus mechanism. As a result, they can provide massive returns on investments (ROI) for early investors.

According to the bar chart, traders preferred altcoin USD was the most valuable anchor since the United States economy was the best in the world in 2022. The other valuable anchors in order were gold, British GBP, Japanese Yen, and Chinese RMB. 

The final table in the dashboard illustrates the token couples that brought the most revenue to the company, with the two most valuable token ids 11 and 13.

In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market witnessed strong volatility in February 2022 and a decline from March 2022, which was linked to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine at that time. Vietnam was the country that contributed the most to the company's revenue since the company operated mainly in this country. As for traders, they were people who liked to take risks and wanted to earn a large ROI in a short time right after investing in altcoins. Regarding the stablecoins, the USD was the most used because the US had the greatest influence on the global economy.
